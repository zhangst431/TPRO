Tumor epithelial tissue is composed of the cancer cells themselves and can vary in appearance depending on the specific subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. Under the microscope, tumor epithelial tissue may appear as solid nests, acinar structures, or papillary formations. The cells may have enlarged and irregular nuclei, and may show signs of atypia or mitotic activity.
Necrosis tissue is composed of dead or dying cells and is often seen in the center of large tumors or in areas of rapid growth. Necrosis may appear as areas of pink, amorphous material under the microscope, and may be surrounded by viable tumor cells and stroma.
Lymphocyte tissue is composed of immune cells that have infiltrated the tumor and the surrounding stroma. Lymphocyte infiltration is a common feature of non-small cell lung cancer and can be a sign of an active immune response against the tumor. Under the microscope, lymphocytes may appear as small, darkly staining cells that are clustered together in certain areas of the tumor or stroma.
Tumor-associated stroma tissue is the connective tissue that surrounds and supports the tumor epithelial tissue. In non-small cell lung cancer, the stroma may be infiltrated by inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts. The stroma may also contain blood vessels and areas of fibrosis.
