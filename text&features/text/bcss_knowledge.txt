Tumor epithelial tissue in H&E stained images typically appears as irregular clusters or groups with various shapes. They can form glandular or solid structures and may appear as fragments or clusters of cells. The color of tumor epithelial tissue can vary, but it usually shows densely stained cells. The nuclei often appear darker, indicating a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, while the cytoplasm is relatively scarce. Tumor epithelial tissue is usually the core component of the tumor. It may be surrounded or infiltrated by tumor-associated stroma tissue. Tumor cells can invade the surrounding stromal elements.
Tumor-associated stroma tissue in H&E stained images can exhibit various forms. It can be fibrous, composed of collagen fibers, or cellular, containing inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and other cellular components. The color of tumor-associated stroma tissue depends on its composition. Collagen-rich stroma may appear pink, while cellular components may appear blue or purple. Tumor-associated stroma tissue surrounds and infiltrates the tumor epithelial tissue. It provides a supportive environment for tumor growth and may interact with lymphocyte tissue.
Lymphocytes in H&E stained images typically appear as small round cells. They can exist in a scattered form or form clusters within the tumor or surrounding stroma. Lymphocytes usually appear as dark blue or purple cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. The nuclei are round or slightly indented. Lymphocyte tissue can be found within and around the tumor. Lymphocytes infiltrate the tumor epithelial tissue and may interact with tumor-associated stroma tissue. Lymphocytes can form clusters or be dispersed within the tumor tissue.
Necrosis tissue in H&E stained images appears as irregular areas, often in a fragmentary form. It can lead to disrupted tissue structures with unclear boundaries. Necrosis tissue typically appears as amorphous, pink, or pale staining. Necrotic areas may lack viable cells and nuclear staining, presenting as areas of cellular debris. Necrosis tissue can be seen within the tumor epithelial tissue or in close proximity to it. The presence of necrosis may indicate tumor invasiveness and can lead to inflammatory responses and the infiltration of other tissues.
